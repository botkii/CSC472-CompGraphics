# Running CSC472 Computer Graphics Project in Visual Studio

Yes, you can definitely run this Qt project in Visual Studio! The project is already configured for Visual Studio (see the `win32-msvc*` section in the .pro file). Here are the detailed steps:

## Prerequisites
1. **Visual Studio** (2019 or later recommended)
2. **Qt Framework** installed on your system
3. **Qt Visual Studio Tools** extension (optional but recommended)

## Method 1: Generate Visual Studio Project Files (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Qt
- Download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download
- Make sure Qt is in your system PATH, or note the installation directory

### Step 2: Generate Visual Studio Project
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project directory and run:
```cmd
qmake -tp vc CS472.pro
```
This will generate:
- `CS472.vcxproj` (Visual Studio project file)
- `CS472.sln` (Visual Studio solution file)

### Step 3: Open in Visual Studio
- Double-click `CS472.sln` or open it from Visual Studio
- Visual Studio will load the project with all source files

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings
- Select **Debug** or **Release** configuration
- Ensure the platform is set to **x64** (the project is configured for 64-bit)

### Step 5: Build and Run
- Press **F5** to build and run with debugging
- Or press **Ctrl+F5** to run without debugging
- Or use **Build → Build Solution** then run

## Method 2: Using Qt Visual Studio Tools Extension

### Step 1: Install Qt Visual Studio Tools
- In Visual Studio, go to **Extensions → Manage Extensions**
- Search for "Qt Visual Studio Tools" and install it
- Restart Visual Studio

### Step 2: Import Qt Project
- Go to **Extensions → Qt VS Tools → Open Qt Project File (.pro)**
- Select your `CS472.pro` file
- The extension will convert it to a Visual Studio project

### Step 3: Configure Qt Settings
- Go to **Extensions → Qt VS Tools → Qt Options**
- Add your Qt installation path if it's not detected automatically

## Method 3: Manual Project Creation (Advanced)

If the above methods don't work, you can create a new Visual Studio project and manually add all the files:

1. **Create New Project**:
   - File → New → Project
   - Choose "Console App" or "Empty Project"
   - Name it CS472

2. **Add Qt Support**:
   - Right-click project → Properties
   - Add Qt include paths and libraries

3. **Add Source Files**:
   - Copy all .cpp and .h files to the project
   - Add them to the Visual Studio project

## Project Configuration Notes

The project is already configured for Visual Studio with these settings:
- **Target**: x64 architecture
- **Libraries**: OpenGL32 is linked
- **Compiler flags**: Multi-processor compilation enabled (`/MP`)
- **Debug info**: Full debug information (`/Zi`)

## Troubleshooting

**Qt not found**:
- Ensure Qt is installed and accessible
- Add Qt bin directory to system PATH
- Set QTDIR environment variable

**Build errors**:
- Make sure you're building for x64 platform
- Check that all OpenGL libraries are available
- Verify Qt version compatibility

**Missing dependencies**:
- Install Visual C++ Redistributable if needed
- Ensure all .glsl shader files are in correct locations

## Expected Result
When successful, you'll have a Visual Studio solution that builds a Qt application with OpenGL graphics for your computer graphics assignments.

The executable will be in the Debug or Release folder and should display a Qt window with 3D graphics rendering.
