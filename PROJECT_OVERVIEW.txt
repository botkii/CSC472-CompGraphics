# CSC472-CompGraphics Project Overview

This repository appears to be a course project for CSC472: Computer Graphics. It is organized into several folders and files, primarily using C++ and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). Below is a summary of the main components and their roles:

## Main Structure
- **main.cpp, MainWindow.cpp/h**: Likely the entry point and main window logic for the application, possibly using Qt for GUI.
- **HW.cpp/h**: General homework or assignment logic shared across tasks.
- **dummy.cpp/h**: Placeholder or test code.

## Geometry
- **geometry/**: Contains C++ classes for geometric primitives (Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, Scene, Geometry). These are used to represent and manipulate 3D objects in the graphics application.

## Camera
- **camera/**: Camera class for handling view transformations and perspective in 3D scenes.

## Lighting
- **lighting/**: Light class for managing scene lighting, likely supporting different light types and properties.

## Homework Assignments
- **hw0, hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4/**: Each folder contains C++ source/header files and GLSL shader files for different homework assignments. These assignments likely cover topics such as:
  - Basic rendering and shaders (hw0)
  - Transformations and object manipulation (hw1)
  - Advanced shading and effects (hw2, hw3, hw4)

## Resources
- **earth.jpg, mandrill.jpg, moon.jpg, sun.jpg**: Image files used as textures or backgrounds in assignments.

## Qt Project Files
- **.pro, .qrc, .rc, .ico, .icns**: Qt project configuration, resource, and icon files for building and running the application with Qt.

## Summary
This project is a comprehensive computer graphics coursework repository. It demonstrates:
- 3D geometry modeling
- Camera and lighting systems
- Use of shaders for rendering
- Application structure with Qt
- Progressive assignments building up graphics concepts

Each folder and file contributes to learning and implementing core graphics techniques, with a focus on C++ and OpenGL/GLSL.
