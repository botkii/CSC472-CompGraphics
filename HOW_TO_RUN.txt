# How to Run the CSC472 Computer Graphics Project

This project is a Qt-based C++ application using OpenGL for computer graphics assignments. Here are the different ways to build and run it:

## Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:
- **Qt Framework** (with Qt Creator IDE recommended)
- **OpenGL libraries** (usually comes with graphics drivers)
- **C++ compiler** (Visual Studio on Windows, GCC on Linux, Clang on macOS)

## Method 1: Using Qt Creator (Recommended)
1. **Install Qt Creator** from https://www.qt.io/download
2. **Open the project**:
   - Launch Qt Creator
   - Go to File → Open File or Project
   - Navigate to your project folder and select `CS472.pro`
3. **Configure the project** when prompted (choose your Qt kit)
4. **Build and Run**:
   - Press Ctrl+R (or Cmd+R on macOS) to build and run
   - Or use the green "Run" button in Qt Creator

## Method 2: Command Line with qmake
1. **Open terminal/command prompt** in the project directory
2. **Generate Makefile**:
   ```bash
   qmake CS472.pro
   ```
3. **Build the project**:
   - On Windows: `nmake` (if using Visual Studio) or `mingw32-make` (if using MinGW)
   - On Linux/macOS: `make`
4. **Run the executable**:
   - On Windows: `./release/CS472.exe` or `./debug/CS472.exe`
   - On Linux/macOS: `./CS472`

## Method 3: Using Visual Studio (Windows)
If you have Visual Studio with Qt Visual Studio Tools:
1. **Generate Visual Studio project**:
   ```bash
   qmake -tp vc CS472.pro
   ```
2. **Open the generated .vcxproj file** in Visual Studio
3. **Build and run** using Visual Studio's interface

## Project Structure Notes
- The main executable will be named `CS472`
- The project includes multiple homework assignments (hw0, hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4)
- Each assignment likely has different rendering modes or features
- The application uses Qt widgets for the GUI and OpenGL for graphics rendering

## Troubleshooting
- **Qt not found**: Make sure Qt is installed and in your system PATH
- **OpenGL errors**: Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date
- **Build errors**: Check that all required dependencies are installed
- **Missing files**: Ensure all .cpp, .h, and .glsl files are present

## Running Specific Assignments
The application likely has a menu or interface to switch between different homework assignments (HW0a, HW0b, etc.). Each assignment demonstrates different computer graphics concepts and techniques.

## Expected Output
When running successfully, you should see a Qt window with OpenGL rendering area displaying 3D graphics based on the selected homework assignment.
